        <h1>Our Mission</h1>
        <p>At A Bit of Love, our mission is to provide compassionate and comprehensive 24-hour supported living for children in need across Idaho. We strive to create a nurturing environment that offers a stable home, nutritious meals, comfortable housing, and essential living necessities to children facing challenging circumstances.</p>
        <p>Guided by the rules and regulations set forth by the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare, we are committed to upholding the highest standards of care and accountability. Our dedicated team ensures that each child receives the necessary clothing, bedding, and transportation to and from appointments, fostering a secure and supportive living experience.</p>
        <p>Central to our mission is the provision of trauma-informed care, grounded in Trust-Based Relational Intervention (TBRI). We acknowledge the unique challenges our residents face and recognize the importance of addressing trauma to pave the way for their successful integration into normal, ordinary homes.</p>
        <p>Our facility sets itself apart by integrating Licensed Clinical Social Work (LCSW) services, ensuring that professional mental health support is readily available. Through the expertise of our on-staff LCSW, we empower children to work through their trauma, achieve stabilization, and develop therapeutic strategies to overcome the challenges they may encounter.</p>
        <p>At A Bit of Love, we are dedicated to making a lasting impact in the lives of these children, providing them with a safe haven where they can heal, grow, and ultimately transition to homes that offer love, stability, and a brighter future.</p>
        <p>We have in house Psychiatric, Medical, and a Psychotherapy Center where we can provide immediate and ongoing care. We strive to ensure that mental health care is readily available for our children.</p>
